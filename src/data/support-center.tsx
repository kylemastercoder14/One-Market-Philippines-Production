        When you place an order, 1 Market Philippines contacts the issuing bank
        to confirm the validity of the payment method. Your bank reserves the
        funds until the transaction processes or the authorization expires. This
        reservation appears immediately in your statement, but it isn't an
        actual charge If you cancel your order, the authorization is removed

        bank to clarify how long they hold authorizations for online orders.

        your device or permission to use your card. If you believe your 1 Market
